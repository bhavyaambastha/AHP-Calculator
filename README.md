## What is the Analytic Hierarchy Process?

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, using math and psychology. It was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s and has been refined since then. It contains three parts: the ultimate goal or problem youâ€™re trying to solve, all of the possible solutions, called alternatives, and the criteria you will judge the alternatives on. AHP provides a rational framework for a needed decision by quantifying its criteria and alternative options, and for relating those elements to the overall goal.

With the help of the [ahp node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ahp) and [charist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), we were able to make this AHP visualization tool a reality.
